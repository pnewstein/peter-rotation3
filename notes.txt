Emily did the disection. if oced on cotex neurons
The new capilary tubes made less consistant pippettes but seemed to more or less work

Cell1 not very good. A cortex pyrimdal cell
78 pF
35 mOHM resistance
pippette 5mOHM
RA = 12.7
practiced pulling out
got 1.5 Gohm
cell2 mHb!!!!
Cm 22pF
rM = 200
Ra 41
Ran tons of fi curves on the cell
Pulled out. Got a ouside out resistance of 1.3Gohm not bad
Cut goes on the RIGT cortex up


Cell3 Much worse resistnace = 50mOHM
Acsess resistance is 16Mohm
Cm 63
RMP = 38 I recorded at for 20
I put both cells into PFA overnight. I moved to PBS the next day at 2pm
Cut goes on the opposite side

Using the TH>channelrhodopsin2 mice
cage 323

born 3/24 22

got a weird cell; acsess resistance 1mOHM 
imput resistance 800mOHM
14pFarad capacidence
rmp -30
injected current to keep at -70 decided to pull out when input resistance droped to 200MOHM
There was something connected to my tip after I pulled out. The thing connected to the tip didnt flouresce
i pealed off a corner of the rigt cortex

emily disected the animal which was a female mouse born 3/29/2022
genotype TH x ChR2
cage number 323
I got 6 slices containing habenula
Moved to acsf at 5:20
I finaly patched a habenula cell at 8:30pm
got a 2 gohm seal. probably th negitive
500mOHM
cm =12
ra = 40 I will try to improve ra
drugs at 35
lost my cell at 36
got to 8 gohm in pullout
could not get another cell. put though std biocyten protocol
